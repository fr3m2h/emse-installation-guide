To effectively use all required software throughout your studies at École des Mines de Saint-Étienne (EMSE), here is the recommended minimum configuration for your personal computer:

## General Specifications

- **Processor:** Intel Core i5 or equivalent, with virtualization capability enabled.
- **RAM:** 8 GB minimum (16 GB recommended).
- **Disk Space:** At least 250 GB reserved for academic purposes.
- **Operating System:** Windows 10/11, macOS (High Sierra or higher), or Linux.
- **Screen:** Minimum of 13 inches.
- **Network Connection:** Wi-Fi and wired connections recommended.

## Laptop Loan Provided by the School

If you do not have the required configuration and your financial resources do not allow you to purchase one, you can request a loaned laptop (PC/Windows) from the school for the academic year. This request must be renewed annually.

Due to a limited number of available machines, requests will be reviewed by a committee based on defined criteria, including financial needs. You must fill out the “Laptop Request Form” and attach it to your registration file.

The provision of a laptop by the school is subject to a loan agreement and acceptance of its terms of use, summarized below:

- The laptop remains the property of MINES Saint-Étienne, and its initial setup is managed by the IT department (including remote monitoring).
- Installing software unrelated to your studies is prohibited.
- The IT department reserves the right to reclaim the laptop if terms of use are violated.

Please ensure you follow these recommendations to guarantee the optimal functioning of software used throughout your studies.
